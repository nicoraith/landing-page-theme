Art imitates life and life imitates art - Cinema has the power to capture the zeitgeist of an era. In this project we will be studying gender representation in cinema to better understand trends in societal sentiments. Our goal is to assess if representations differ by gender and if they have evolved through time. This project is motivated by the fact that the 20th century was a time of dynamic social upheavel and mobility, e.g., in Switzerland, womens sufferage at the federal level was granted as late as 1971.
