description: |
---

The following questions do not comprise an exhaustive list, but are fundamental to study gender representation in movies. They serve to scope, inspire, and guide the analysis.

* What is the prevalence of m/f characters?
* Is there a discrepency in age between m/f characters? 
* How can we differentiate between depictions of male and female characters?
    + How do they act? How do others act unto them?
    + How are they described?
* Can we extract archetypes / stereotypes across genders through lexical analysis?
* Do the aforementioned questions show an evolution over time? Do they show discernable differences across geographies?
