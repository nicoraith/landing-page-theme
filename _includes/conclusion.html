                    <div class="lead">Ultimately our exploration of the CMU movie summary provided mixed results. While we were certainly able to extract differences in the cinema industry's treatment of characters based on gender, they were quite limited in expression. The differences are exemplified in the different agent and patient verbs as well as attributes. Using these features we employed a variety of lexical groupings, primary component analysis, and clustering to differentiate the male and female characters. What fell somewhat flat was the analysis through time as our limited definitions of archetype clusters did not behave as dynamically as we had supposed they would. This is not inherently a shortcoming but simply demonstrates that cinema indeed has a ways to go until an equitable distribution of descriptions and roles are had between genders.  Another observation was that the way we formed clusters allowed for more or less differences in archetypes representation through time. Fine tuning the clusters may have led to more archetypes with more transience through the decades. Ultimately we would have liked to explore different lexical tools than empath which we relied upon heavily but were unable to produce a large amount of disparate gendered clusters from. Data was also limited due to movie summaries not being as rich as the script, directing, or cinematography which we believe would play a humongous differential role in treatment by gender.
