                        In the following visualization,  we compiled bags of words over the entire movie summaries split by gender. All words describing women and men were separately tagged into their group words shown on the vertical axis.The displayed results are normalized to account for the different amount of male and female characters. The results have been sorted in descending frequency for the women's results.

                            The bag of women for women has much higher relative extremes than that of men. This indicates that women have a narrower range of associated words and could be interpreted as an indicator for the lack of depth in descriptors and actions associated with female characters
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Conversely, the male distribution is closer to normal, indicting a much broader pool of associated lexical fields and therefore a more broad set of roles, attributes, and actions done by and onto them.

                            Men outscore women in the following groups: death, leader, business, violence, kill, crime, driving, aggression, fight, stealing, prison, war, weaponâ€¦ This corroborates the results of PC1 in which we saw overlapping terms as having the strongest explanatory coefficient
