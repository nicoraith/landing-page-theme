                        PCA was conducted to determine if the word categories are sufficient in differentiating between genders. Figure 11 graphically represents the separation of m/f characters by the first two primary components.

                            Principle component 1 is able to efficiently separate male and female characters. PC1 is highly positively correlated with groups such as family, wedding, attractive, domestic work, sexual, feminine, beauty, while being highly negatively correlated with groups including money, crime, masculine, prison, aggression, war, and fighting. These extremes separate our characters in two very distinct sets.

                        <li>
                            Principle component 2 is far less effective (there is more overlap along this dimension). However, it does subtly reveal that the range of word groups associated with men are more diverse than that of women. This is conducive with the theory that representation of women in media is rather limited and women are cast in a flat set of roles.

                        To have a better understanding of the evolution of the female and male characters representation in time we divided the time periods in which the movies where released (before 1960, 1960-2000, after 2000), and we created groups based in this division and the gender of the characters (see Fig. 12). Then, we used as PCA samples the different groups. The results show that the first principal component can discriminate between female and male characters, and that the difference between male and female characters for a same period of time decreases as we advance in time.  From this analysis, the female representations are getting closer to the male ones. The first principal component is the one explaining more variance in the data (>50%), and in this case it shows that distance between female and male characters belonging to a same time period decreases as time goes by. Interestingly, for this component male characters have not evolved since the 1960's, while females representations are still changing.
